## host is hard coded to my (martin) test VM

## will not working for anyone else since only my public key is on the VM

## Created the directory structure with ansible-galaxy init (followed some guide)
## i.e. 'ansible-galaxy init mysql' generates the role mysql and all subforders with empty .yml files

## This is probably very messy
